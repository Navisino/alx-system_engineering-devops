Issue Summary:

During the period of 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM EAT on Sunday, April 14th, 2024, our cloud storage service encountered a two-hour outage. Throughout this time, users were unable to access their files. This disruption affected 67% of our user base, causing considerable interruptions to their regular workflows.

Root Cause:

The primary reason for the outage stemmed from a hardware malfunction within our storage server infrastructure. More precisely, a defective disk caused data corruption, thereby hindering access to the pertinent files.

Timeline:

1:00 PM EAT: An elevated error rate on the impacted server was flagged by our monitoring system, indicating an outage.

1:04 PM EAT: An engineer was dispatched to investigate the issue and determine its root cause.

1:37 PM EAT: The engineer pinpointed the affected server and initiated efforts to restore file access.

1:45 PM EAT: After confirming the need for a disk replacement, the engineer escalated the matter to our infrastructure team for coordination.

2:15 PM EAT: Our infrastructure team commenced the replacement of the faulty disk.

3:00 PM EAT: The replacement of the faulty disk was completed, and access to the affected files was restored. Normal service resumed.

Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Initially, our engineer suspected network connectivity issues, prompted by reports from users experiencing sluggish upload and download speeds. This led to a portion of time being dedicated to troubleshooting the network before accurately pinpointing the root cause as a hardware failure.

Actions Taken:

Upon confirming the hardware failure, our infrastructure team swiftly organised the replacement of the defective disk. We maintained regular communication with our users via social media channels and email updates to ensure they remained informed throughout the duration of the outage.




Root Cause and Resolution:

The main issue behind the outage stemmed from a malfunctioning disk in our storage server. We promptly replaced the faulty disk and successfully restored the affected files. To prevent similar hardware failures in the future, we plan to enhance our monitoring systems for early detection and prevention measures.


Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To forestall future incidents, we will enact the subsequent corrective and preventive actions:
1. Enhance monitoring of disk health and establish alerts for potential disk failures.
2. Enhance our disaster recovery plan to mitigate the impact of hardware failures.
3. Bolster infrastructure redundancy to diminish the probability of widespread outages.
4. Conduct routine assessments of our systems and procedures to pinpoint areas for enhancement.
5. Formulate a communication strategy to promptly inform users of outages and furnish status updates.

Conclusion:

We regret any inconvenience caused by the recent outage and remain dedicated to providing a dependable and top-notch service to our users. We've taken measures to rectify the underlying problem and are committed to further enhancing our systems and procedures to avert similar occurrences in the future.
